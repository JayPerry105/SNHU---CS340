Client/Server Development



- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When it comes to writing code that meets these criteria, properly stucturing and commenting the code plays a large role. When code is properly commented and in a generally accepted format, it becomes much easier
for another programmer to jump in and get a grasp on what the code is doing and why it was written a certain way. The CRUD module we created could be very useful and many different scenarios when considering working with databases.
The module serves as a building block for a many applications when working with databases given that when wokring with databases, creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries are some of
the most common operations that will be taking place.

    
- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The best way I have found to look at problems throughout my coursework has been to break it up into smaller sections rather than trying to tackle an entire project all at once.
With this project, I tried to knock out 2 or 3 dashboard specific requirements every time I worked on it, so it did not seem lilke such a daunting task. I really liked
the structure of the work in this course. From the start of the course, we realistically were piecing together our final project without even realizing we were working on it.
I would follow a similar process to this course if I ever need to create a database or database functionality in a real world scenario in the future.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In my mind, computer scientists are problem solvers. Of course there are many aspects to being a computer scientist, but it always seems to come down to solving problems in the most
efficient ways possible. Efficiency is key in computer science related scenarios, as many programs and users rely on extremely fast and responsive user interfaces and software
applications. Solving a problem, like we did in this project for Grazioso Salvare, helps the individuals trying to find suitable dogs for training. It also helps the dogs themselves in many cases,
since they will be easier to find and rescued from the shelters.
